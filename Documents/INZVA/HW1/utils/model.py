        Args:
        - method (str): The initialization method for the weights. Can be one of:
            - 'xavier': Applies Xavier uniform initialization.
            - 'kaiming': Applies Kaiming uniform initialization.
            - 'random_normal': Initializes weights from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.01.

        - x (torch.Tensor): Input tensor containing the batch of data with dimensions matching the input_size.
